# Stock Analysis
A client is performing brokerage services and needs to see how several stocks have performed for two years. Visual Basic in Excel was used for the financial analysis of the stock data.  Code was originally written to perfom the analysis, but was refactored to improve efficiency.
### Process

Data for financial stocks were downloaded and filtered for twelve select stocks.

Code was written to format a table to provide information that is easily accessible for the client

Buttons were programmed so that the client would never have to open a developer tab and deal with macros.  The buttons are designed to run an analysis for a desired year, highlight the returns so that negative returns are red and positive returns are green, remove the highlights for optical preferences, and to reset the entire worksheet, respectively.
